# FCC Filing Text Analysis

**WARNING: These are BIG files. There are millions of responses, which add up even though they're text files. Proceed with caution if you're running the script on all of the files.


Data are available [here](http://www.fcc.gov/files/ecfs/14-28/ecfs-files.htm).

The Python file parses the XML documents into individual text files. The R file gets everything set up in a document-term matrix.
